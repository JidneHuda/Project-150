<h1>Pacman Game</h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>
Pacman Game in C is a basic console program or a little clip game created for amusement purposes. It is
similar to the snake game in that Pacman must be directed in such a manner that he advances down a
predetermined blue route before it is deleted or devoured by Pacman. The more you clear the way, the more
points you get; the game is simple to play.

<h2>Gameplay:</h2>
Pacman's movement is controlled by the key board's navigation keys (up, down, left, and right). Pacman's
movement is paused by using the space bar. You will be the winner if you can drive the Pacman along all of
the lines such that he consumes everything.

<h2>Development Goal:</h2>
The .c files of Pacman Game have been listed as follows:</br>
main.c</br> 
map.c</br>
move_guide.c</br>
accessories.h</br>
header.h is a user-defined header file produced in the game's source code. The game's C files are used to
control Pacman's velocity and direction, as well as to generate the route. The Pacman Game in C
demonstrates the usage of file handling, the use of user-defined header files, and the combining of many C
files in a single project, among other things.
